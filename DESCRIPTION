Description: Utilities for working with hourly air quality monitoring data
    with a focus on small particulates (PM2.5). A compact data model is 
    structured as a list with two dataframes. A 'meta' dataframe contains 
    spatial and measuring device metadata associated with deployments at known 
    locations. A 'data' dataframe contains a 'datetime' column followed by 
    columns of measurements associated with each "device-deployment".
