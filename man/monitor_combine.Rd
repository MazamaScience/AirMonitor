\usage{
monitor_combine(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Any number of valid emph{monitor} objects.}
}
\value{
A combined \code{monitor} object.
}
\description{
Create a combined \emph{monitor} from any number of \emph{monitor}
objects or from a list of \emph{monitor} objects. The resulting \emph{monitor}
object with contain all \code{deviceDeploymentIDs} found in any incoming
\emph{monitor} and will have a regular time axis covering the the entire range
of incoming data.

If incoming time ranges are non-contiguous, the resulting \emph{monitor} will
have gaps filled with \code{NA} values.

An error is generated if the incoming \emph{monitor} objects have
non-identical metadata for the same \code{deviceDeploymentID}.
}
\note{
Data are combined with a "latest is best" sensibility where any
data overlaps exist. Incoming \emph{monitor} objects are ordered based on the
time stamp of their last record. Any data records found in a "later" \emph{monitor}
will overwrite data associated with an "earlier" \emph{monitor}.
